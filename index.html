			<h1>Resources and Content from Ficly and ficlets</h1>

      <p>This site serves as a place to grab things related to Ficly and ficlets now that they're officially sunset (see the <a href="http://ficly.com/blog/farewell-ficly">blog post in The Writer’s Room</a>) and the static sites are live. If you'd like to do something with the stories created on either sites, there are files you can use in the two repos linked below.</p>

      <p>Thank you to everyone who loved ficlets and Ficly and all the people who wrote stories, comments, and rated things. It was a joy to bring it to life.</p>
